[git][gitUrl] is one of the most used tools in the world,
<br />
but there's some routine commands you always do it
<br />
corgit'll do all this boring work,
<br />
**in init command you should type**

```sh
# init
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "$COMMIT_MSG"
$ git branch -M $BRANCH_NAME
$ git remote add origin $REPO_URL
$ git push -u origin $BRANCH_NAME
```

you should type 6 lines, in corgit you can do it simpley

```sh
$ cgit i

# it's well ask you, commit message, branch name, repo url, and push it
```

just this

**in push command**

in original git

```sh
# push
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "$COMMIT_MSG"
```

in **cgit**

```sh
$ cgit ph

# it's well just ask you commit msg
```

**git status in list view**

_hint: you should install `colorls` to show this_

in orginal git, if you type `git status`

it's well show you like this

```sh
$ git status

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

it's not very pretty

but if you type `cgit sl`

![Result](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ctgcbxw1ywz6y1u4jdri.png)
