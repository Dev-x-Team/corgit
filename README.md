[git][gitUrl] is one of the most used tools in the world,
<br />
but there's some routine commands you always do it
<br />
corgit'll do all this boring work,
<br />
**in init command you should type**

```sh
# init
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "$COMMIT_MSG"
$ git branch -M $BRANCH_NAME
$ git remote add origin $REPO_URL
$ git push -u origin $BRANCH_NAME
```

you should type 6 lines, in corgit you can do it simpley

```sh
$ cgit i

# it's well ask you, commit message, branch name, repo url, and push it
```

just this

**in push command**

in original git

```sh
# push
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "$COMMIT_MSG"
```

in **cgit**
